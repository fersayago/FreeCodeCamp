                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data
                    structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant
                    syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
                    scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary
                    form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
                    distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party
                    Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++
                    (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for
                    customizable applications.</p>
                <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python
                    language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all
                    examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</p>
                <p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python
                    Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++,
                    read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are
                    also several books covering Python in depth.</p>
                <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every
                    commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will
                    give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read
                    and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python
                    library modules described in The Python Standard Library.</p>

                    Many beginning Python users are wondering with which version of Python they should start. My answer
                    to this question is usually
                    something along the lines “just go with the version your favorite tutorial was written in, and check
                    out the differences later on.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python 3 is strongly recommended for any new development. As of January 2020, Python 2 has reached
                    End Of Life status,
                    meaning it will receive no further updates or bugfixes, including for security issues. Many
                    frameworks and other add on projects
                    are following a similar policy. As such, we can only recommend learning and teaching Python 3.

                To get started with writing Python, you need to have the latest version of Python 3 installed and write
                on a IDE or the python console
                <code>print("Hello world!")</code>
                Once you run this code you should be able to see the message "Hello World!" displayed on the console.

            <p>
                Think of a variable as a name attached to a particular object. In Python, variables need not be declared or
                defined in advance,
                as is the case in many other programming languages. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and
                then start using it.
                Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=):
            </p>
            <code>>>> n = 300</code>
            <p>
                This is read or interpreted as “n is assigned the value 300.” Once this is done, n can be used in a
                statement or expression,
                and its value will be substituted:
            </p>
            <code>>>> print(n) 
300
            </code>
            <p>
                Just as a literal value can be displayed directly from the interpreter prompt in a REPL session without the
                need for print(),
                so can a variable:
            </p>
            <code>>>> n
300
            </code>
            <p>Later, if you change the value of n and use it again, the new value will be substituted instead:</p>
            <code>>>> n = 1000
>>> print(n)
1000
>>> n
1000
            </code>
            <p>
                Python also allows chained assignment, which makes it possible to assign the same value to several variables
                simultaneously:
            </p>
            <code>>>> a = b = c = 300
>>> print(a, b, c)
300 300 300
            </code>
            <p>The chained assignment above assigns 300 to the variables a, b, and c simultaneously.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_types">
            <header>Variable types</header>
            <p>
                In many programming languages, variables are statically typed. That means a variable is initially
                declared to have a specific
                data type, and any value assigned to it during its lifetime must always have that type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variables in Python are not subject to this restriction. In Python, a variable may be assigned a value
                of one type and then
                later re-assigned a value of a different type:
            </p>
            <code>>>> var = 23.5
>>> print(var)
23.5
>>> var = "Now I'm a string"
>>> print(var)
Now I'm a string
            </code>

                Now you know how to interact with the Python interpreter and execute Python code. It’s time to dig into the Python language.
                First up is a discussion of the basic data types that are built into Python. These are the data types available on Python:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Integers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Floating-point numbers
                </li>
                <il>
                    Complex numbers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strings
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boolean type, boolean context and "truthiness"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built-in functions
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="If...else_statement">
            <header>If...else statement</header>
                <p>If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:</p>
            <code>>>> a = 2
>>> b = 330
>>> print("A") if a > b else print("B")
B
            </code>
            <p>You can also have multiple else statements on the same line</p>
